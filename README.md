# TypeScript Starter

Uses `"strict"` settings, includes `eslint`, `prettier`, the each and everything.

1. `npm run tsc` for `tsc -w`
2. In separate terminal window, `npm start` to have `nodemon` watch the built files. Runs with `node --experimental`.
3. If desired, in another terminal window, `npm test` to run `jest --watch`

## ðŸŽ¶

Add: `"new-cap": ["error", { capIsNewExceptions: "Router" }],` to `.eslintrc.cjs` to avoid issue when doing with TS/ESLint when doing: `const router = Router()` (or similar).

This includes opinions, especially in `.vscode/settings.json`. If you are beginner, especially, I am urge you to give them a solid try before making changes. And, feel free to give me some feedback on this too!
